The voigt profile routine is loosely based on a version written by
Jochen Liske in VPGUESS, which can be downloaded from:
http://www.eso.org/~jliske/vpguess/

The atom.dat file is taken from vpfit, with several additions from
Verner et al. 

The sed module is heavily influenced by the astLib sed module by Matt
Hilton: http://astlib.sourceforge.net/

The dust extinction law functions were inspired by those in Erik
Tollerud's Astropysics: http://packages.python.org/Astropysics/
