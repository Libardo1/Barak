This package contains functions useful for general scientific
programming, with a focus on astronomical research. The documentation
details everything that is available, but some example tasks that can
be handled are:

  * Calculate cosmological distance measures for various cosmologies.
  * Find the expected broad-band magnitudes given a spectral energy
    distribution.
  * Calculate absorption profiles for various ions observed in
    astrophysical environments.
  * Fit a smooth continuum to a spectrum with many emission or
    absorption features.

To install, run:

   python setup.py install

To test, you need py.test installed.  Run 

   py.test barak 

from this directory.
